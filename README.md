Import weather data from OpenWeather API, create map layers for vacation destinations and itinerary using GMaps API.

------------------------------
# Overview of Project
Create map layers and markers using API calls from OpenWeather and Google Maps.

## Project Tasks
Create following resources:

1. Weather Database folder: .ipynb and .csv files.
2. Vacation Search folder: .ipynb and .csv files, map image.
3. Vacation Itinerary folder: .ipynb file and two map images. 

## Resources
-- Data Source: OpenWeather, Google Maps

-- Software: Python, Pandas, GMaps

# Project Results
-- Analysis Output: 
Map images with various heat map, marker, and direction layers.
Files: weatherpy_vacation_map, weatherpy_travel_map, weatherpy_travel_map_markers)


# Project Summary

Created vacation search map and vacation itinerary map based on weather data and nearby hotel searches based on dataset of random Lat/Long coordinates. 

This project can easily be adapted to create Google Map layers with information from other datasets containing Lat/Long coordinates, obtained from API calls or otherwise.
